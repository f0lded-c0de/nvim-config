# Installation

### Requirements:

- [deno](https://deno.com) is required to use the markdown live preview plugin in the nvim_note config.


### Set up:

Clone this repo in your `~/.config/` (or equivalent), and add these lines to `~/.zshrc` :
```bash
export NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-config/nvim_base
alias nv="export NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-config/nvim_base && nvim" # Switch to and open with basic config
alias nvn="export NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-config/nvim_note && nvim" # Switch to and open with note-taking config
alias nvc="export NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-config/nvim_code && nvim" # Switch to and open with coding config
```
You can then use these aliases to open NeoVim with any config.
