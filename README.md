# Installation

### Requirements:

- [deno](https://deno.com) is required to use the markdown live preview plugin in the nvim_note config.


### Set up:

Clone this repo in your `~/.config/` (or equivalent), and add these lines to `~/.zshrc` :
```bash
export NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-config/nvim_base
alias nv="export NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-config/nvim_base && nvim" # Switch to and open with basic config
alias nvn="export NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-config/nvim_note && nvim" # Switch to and open with note-taking config
alias nvc="export NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-config/nvim_code && nvim" # Switch to and open with coding config
```
You can then use these aliases to open NeoVim with any config.

## nvim_code

Coding dedicated config. Include stuff to help write/edit code as well as testing it. Tested only with the C language, although nothing I implemented was only designed for the C language.

### Plugins included:

- [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)
    * Inline syntax errors (compilation errors).
    * Can probably do other stuff, but didn't want to get into it as it was only for the inline errors that I added it.
- [toggleterm.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim)
    * Integrated terminal manager.
    * Very powerful, can be used to manage several terminals in various ways at the same time, but I only included it in order to make managing one terminal much more intuitive than it is by default.
    * Custom keybindings :
        + Toggle term on and off : `<C-\>`
        + Toggle term in vertical, horizontal, float, or tab mode : `(<leader><C-{first_letter_of_mode}>)`
        + Now works in terminal mode : `<esc>`
        + Now works in terminal mode : `<C-{h, j, k, l}>`
            + Lets the terminal in terminal mode, so you can naviguate seamlessly while never leaving terminal mode in your term.
        + Exits terminal mode and then does `<C-w>` : `<C-w>`
    * Size for horizontal and vertical mode can be changed in the keybinds in `/lua/config/toggleterm.lua`.

### Custom Keybindings:

| Keybinding             | Action                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `<C-\>`                | Toggle term on and off    |
| `(<leader><C-{mode}>)` | Toggle term in {mode} |


### Custom Settings:

```lua
vim.opt.smartindent = true
```
